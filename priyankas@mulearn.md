### About Me

Hello, my name is Priyanka S, and I'm from Vandiperiyar, Idukki. I recently graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Mar Baselios Christian College, with a CGPA of 9.07.

I have hands-on experience from internships at ITProFound India Pvt. Ltd. and ReverTech IT Solutions, where I worked on software development and web projects using React.js and Python. Additionally, I have leadership experience as a Hackathon Organizer and a Student Union Council Member, coordinating events like the Thandava 2K24 Tech Fest.

I've developed projects like the Mental Health Well-Being App, FilmFlex movie application, and a web tool for colorblind users. My strengths include problem-solving, communication, and adaptability, though I'm working on balancing my detail-oriented nature with better time management.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, and listening to music. I'm fluent in Tamil, Malayalam, and English, which helps me connect with diverse communities.

I'm excited to bring my technical and leadership skills to your team!
